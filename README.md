<h2>ðŸ“± Week Calendar â€“ Android App</h2>

<p>
  I developed an Android application named <strong>Week Calendar</strong> using <strong>Kotlin</strong> and <strong>Jetpack Compose</strong>, focusing on modern Android UI principles and clean architecture. The primary goal of the app is to provide users with a <strong>simple, intuitive, and visually appealing interface</strong> to view and interact with weekly calendar data.
</p>

<p>
  This application offers a comprehensive view of the <strong>current week</strong>, with the current day clearly highlighted for easy recognition. Beyond just displaying the current week, users can <strong>search for or navigate to any week</strong> of the year, making it ideal for planning events, reviewing past weeks, or checking future dates in a clean and efficient manner.
</p>

<p>
  Week Calendar also includes a <strong>multilingual settings feature</strong>, allowing users to seamlessly switch between <em>English</em>, <em>Swedish</em>, and <em>Vietnamese</em>. This ensures accessibility for a broader audience and aligns with the preferences of users in different regions. The interface language can be changed dynamically through the settings menu without requiring a restart of the app.
</p>

<p>
  Another key feature of the app is the <strong>customizable start day of the week</strong>. Users can configure the calendar to begin on <em>Sunday</em>, <em>Monday</em>, or any preferred day, depending on their regional standards or personal habits. This enhances usability for international users, as week-start conventions vary by country and culture.
</p>

<p>
  The app is lightweight, responsive, and follows material design guidelines to ensure a modern user experience. It is well-suited for both casual users who need a simple weekly overview and professionals who require a flexible and efficient planning tool.
